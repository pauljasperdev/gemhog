<objective>
Fix TypeScript error by adding missing `hono` dependency to packages/api.

Purpose: Unblock CI and type checking by resolving module resolution error.
Output: Clean type check pass for the entire monorepo.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add hono dependency to packages/api</name>
  <files>packages/api/package.json</files>
  <action>
The error `Cannot find module 'hono'` occurs because:
- `packages/api/src/context.ts` imports `type { Context as HonoContext } from "hono"`
- But `hono` is not in packages/api's dependencies (it's only in apps/server)

Add `hono` to packages/api's dependencies. Since it's only used for types, it could be a devDependency, but since the import is in runtime code (even if just for types), add as a regular dependency for consistency with how apps/server uses it.

Run:
```bash
cd /home/lima/repo/packages/api && pnpm add hono
```

This will:
1. Add hono to package.json dependencies
2. Update pnpm-lock.yaml
3. Install the package

Note: The version will be whatever is latest. Since apps/server uses `"hono": "^4.8.2"` and node_modules shows 4.11.4, any 4.x version should work.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `pnpm check-types` - should exit with code 0</verify>
  <done>TypeScript finds hono module, type check passes</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Run full type check to confirm all errors are resolved:
```bash
pnpm check-types
```
Should exit with code 0 (no errors).

Also verify the full static analysis pipeline:
```bash
pnpm check && pnpm check-types
```
Both should pass.

<success_criteria>
- `pnpm check-types` exits with code 0
- No TypeScript errors in packages/api or apps/server
- hono is listed in packages/api/package.json dependencies
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-testing-infrastructure/01-08-SUMMARY.md`
