# Phase 3.1 Plan 08: AI Endpoint Security Summary

**Zod validation for AI messages with rate limiting (10 req/min) - fixes SEC-001 and SEC-002**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 7 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-21T10:11:16Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-21T10:18:03Z
- **Tasks:** 3 + 1 test fix
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Added Zod validation schema matching AI SDK v6 UIMessage format
- Implemented in-memory rate limiting (10 requests/minute per IP)
- Return 400 with flattened error details for invalid input
- Return 429 when rate limit exceeded
- Message count limited to 50, text parts limited to 10KB each

## Task Commits

All three tasks were implemented together as one cohesive change:

1. **Tasks 1-3: Add validation and rate limiting** - `801a00c` (fix)
   - Task 1: Rate limiting implemented inline (no extra dependency needed)
   - Task 2: Zod validation schema for UIMessage format
   - Task 3: Rate limiting middleware in /ai endpoint

2. **Test fix: Defer env import in auth.service** - `012903d` (fix)
   - Unit tests were failing due to immediate env validation
   - Applied deferred require() pattern per 03.1-03 decision

**Plan metadata:** `286d6db` (docs: complete plan)

## Files Created/Modified

- `apps/server/src/index.ts` - Added Zod schemas, rate limiter, and validation in /ai endpoint
- `packages/core/src/auth/auth.service.ts` - Deferred env import for testability

## Decisions Made

1. **Inline rate limiting instead of package** - Simpler for single-server deployment, no external dependencies needed
2. **UIMessage parts validation** - AI SDK v6 uses `parts` array with `{type, text}` objects, not simple `{role, content}`
3. **Discriminated union for parts** - TextPartSchema, FilePartSchema, OtherPartSchema with passthrough for unknown types
4. **Fallback to "anonymous" for rate limiting** - If no IP headers present, use "anonymous" as identifier

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Schema structure mismatch**

- **Found during:** Task 2 (Add Zod validation schema)
- **Issue:** Plan assumed simple `{role, content}` message format but AI SDK v6 uses UIMessage with `parts` array
- **Fix:** Created schema matching actual UIMessage format: `{id?, role, parts: [{type, text}], metadata?}`
- **Files modified:** apps/server/src/index.ts
- **Verification:** TypeScript compilation passes, validation works with frontend
- **Committed in:** 801a00c

**2. [Rule 1 - Bug] Auth service env import breaks tests**

- **Found during:** Post-implementation test verification
- **Issue:** auth.service.ts had static import of env which triggered Effect Config validation at module load time, causing unit tests to fail
- **Fix:** Applied deferred require() pattern (established in 03.1-03) - env only loaded when getAuth() is called
- **Files modified:** packages/core/src/auth/auth.service.ts
- **Verification:** Unit tests pass, auth still works at runtime
- **Committed in:** 012903d

---

**Total deviations:** 2 auto-fixed (1 blocking, 1 bug)
**Impact on plan:** Both fixes necessary for correctness - schema adjustment for proper validation, env deferral for test isolation.

## Issues Encountered

- Pre-commit hook requires Biome import organization - applied auto-fix before commit

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- SEC-001 (Input validation) - RESOLVED
- SEC-002 (Rate limiting) - RESOLVED
- AI endpoint now protected against:
  - Malformed payloads (400 error with details)
  - Request flooding (429 after 10 req/min)
  - Oversized messages (10KB limit per text part)
  - Excessive conversation history (50 message limit)
