# Phase 03.2 Plan 04: TDD and Comment Standards Summary

**TDD red-green-refactor workflow and comment quality standards documented with concrete examples**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-21T19:29:27Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-21T19:31:30Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Added TDD Workflow section to TESTING.md explaining red-green-refactor cycle
- Documented "Why Red First Matters" with reasoning (proves test works, forces interface design)
- Expanded CONVENTIONS.md Comments section with quality standards
- Documented archaeological comments anti-pattern with examples

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add TDD practices section to TESTING.md** - `f8ac88f` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Add comment standards section to CONVENTIONS.md** - `a84b163` (docs)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/codebase/TESTING.md` - Added TDD Workflow section with red-green-refactor cycle, workflow example, and when-to-use guidance
- `.planning/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md` - Expanded Comments section with DO/DON'T lists, WHY vs WHAT principle, archaeological comments anti-pattern, issue linking guidance

## Decisions Made

- TDD section placed after "Test Patterns" and before "What to Mock" for logical reading flow
- Comment section restructured from minimal guidance to comprehensive standards with code examples
- Preserved all existing content in both files

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - documentation only.

## Next Phase Readiness

- TDD guidance complete for future development
- Comment standards established for code review consistency
- Ready for 03.2-05 (auth integration tests)
