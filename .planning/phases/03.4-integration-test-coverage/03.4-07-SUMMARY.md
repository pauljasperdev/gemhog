# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 03.4-03
    provides: Auth flow integration tests and test fixtures
provides:
  - Schema CRUD integration tests using auth.sql.ts definitions
  - Direct drizzle API testing pattern (separate from Effect SQL layer)
affects: [future-schema-changes, database-testing]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - Direct drizzle typed API for schema testing
    - Reuse existing test fixtures (truncateAuthTables)

key-files:
  created:
    - packages/core/src/auth/schema.int.test.ts
  modified:
    - playwright.config.ts

key-decisions:
  - "Use direct drizzle API (not Effect) for schema testing - simpler, schema definitions independent of Effect layer"
  - "Test all four auth tables: user, session, account, verification"
  - "Reuse truncateAuthTables fixture from test-fixtures.ts for test isolation"

patterns-established:
  - "Schema CRUD tests verify drizzle definitions work correctly via typed insert/select"
  - "Constraint tests verify unique/foreign key constraints at database level"

# Phase 03.4 Plan 07: Schema CRUD Integration Tests Summary

**Direct drizzle CRUD tests for auth.sql.ts schema definitions - 8 tests covering user, session, account, verification tables with constraint verification**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 10 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-22T18:18:34Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-22T18:28:00Z
- **Tasks:** 1 (+ 1 auto-fix)
- **Files created:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Created schema.int.test.ts with 8 tests covering all auth tables
- Verified CRUD operations work correctly via drizzle typed API
- Verified database constraints (unique email, foreign keys) enforced
- Tests use existing test-fixtures.ts for table truncation

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create schema CRUD integration tests** - `da77af0` (test)
2. **Fix: E2E database connection string** - `fd919d8` (fix)

_Note: Test file was committed as part of a prior refactoring commit._

## Files Created/Modified

- `packages/core/src/auth/schema.int.test.ts` - Schema CRUD integration tests (299 lines)
  - user table: insert/query, unique email constraint
  - session table: insert linked to user, foreign key constraint
  - account table: insert linked to user, provider info storage, foreign key constraint
  - verification table: insert/query

## Decisions Made

- **Use direct drizzle API (not Effect):** Schema definitions are tested independently from the Effect SQL layer. The connection.int.test.ts already tests Effect SQL integration.
- **Test all four auth tables:** Comprehensive coverage of user, session, account, verification tables.
- **Reuse existing fixtures:** Leveraged truncateAuthTables from test-fixtures.ts rather than duplicating cleanup logic.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Fixed E2E test database connection string**
- **Found during:** Verification (running `pnpm test:e2e`)
- **Issue:** E2E tests failing with "password authentication failed for user postgres" - playwright.config.ts had wrong DATABASE_URL default (`postgres:postgres@...gemhog_test` instead of `postgres:password@...gemhog`)
- **Fix:** Updated playwright.config.ts DATABASE_URL default to match docker container credentials
- **Files modified:** playwright.config.ts
- **Verification:** All 6 E2E tests pass
- **Committed in:** fd919d8

## Issues Encountered

- **TypeScript strict null checks:** Drizzle's returning() returns an array, so destructured elements are possibly undefined. Fixed by using index access with optional chaining (`inserted?.id`).
- **Biome formatting:** Pre-commit hook required reformatting the test file. Fixed by running biome format.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Schema CRUD tests complete, covering gap identified in test coverage
- All tests pass: 25 integration tests, 39 unit tests, 6 E2E tests
- E2E tests now properly connect to local PostgreSQL container
- Ready for remaining gap closure plans
